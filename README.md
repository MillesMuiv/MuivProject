# Coding project that focuses on fetching data through APIs, saving, processing and visualising it through a user-frienly interface that doesn't require
# any programming knowledge. Currently the idea is for the code to get data about social media accounts (might change) with options/settings to see graphs/statistics
# that may be useful for the user.
